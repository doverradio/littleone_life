                        Engaging in the Rosary involves a series of prayers that offer deep reflection on the 
                        life events of Jesus and Mary. Hereâ€™s a simple guide to follow:
                    </p>
                    <div className='mb-3'>
                        <img src={rosaryImage} alt="rosary image" />

                        <p>
                            1a. <strong>Begin with the Sign of the Cross:</strong><br />
                            <span style={{ color: 'blue' }}>    
                                In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.
                            </span>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            1b. <strong>Holding the Crucifix:</strong> Start by reciting the Apostles' Creed, an affirmation of faith: <br />
                            <span style={{ color: 'blue' }}>    
                                I believe in God, the Father Almighty, Creator of Heaven and earth; and in Jesus Christ, 
                                His only Son, Our Lord, Who was conceived by the Holy Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, 
                                was crucified; died, and was buried. He descended into Hell; the third day He arose again from the dead; He ascended 
                                into Heaven, sitteth at the right hand of God, the Father Almighty; from thence He shall come to judge the living and 
                                the dead. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy Catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, 
                                the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting. Amen.

                                Give us this day our daily bread; and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us; and lead 
                                us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil, Amen.
